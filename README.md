| S.No. | Title | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Introduction | This lab introduces the basics of programming using **Python**. The notebook presents and solves four problems: computing the area of a circle, finding the largest of three numbers, calculating the factorial of a number, and evaluating the given algebraic expressions. |
| 2 | Simple Programs | This lab introduces the basics of programming using **Python** and focuses on simple computational problems such as interest calculation, geometry, temperature conversion, arithmetic operations, time conversion, and currency handling. |
| 3 | Control Structures: Branching | This lab introduces decision making and branching concepts focussing on the `if-elif-else` and `match-case` statements. |
| 4 | Control Structures: Looping | This lab introduces looping concepts focussing on the `while`, `while True` (similar to do-while in C++) and `for` statements. |
